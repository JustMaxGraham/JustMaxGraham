### Hello World!

ðŸ”­ &nbsp; I am currently working on a small web app for generating cue cards from a shared Google Sheets link. Check out the work in progress here: https://staging.dsga5fqmduts7.amplifyapp.com or the prod build at www.gsheets2cuecards.com ! Built using React, AWS Amplify & Lambda. \
ðŸŒ± &nbsp; Learning ReduxToolkit and AWS Amplify, Gateway & Lambda \
ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Ask me about being in a start up! I have been part of a few, so I have some stories to tell. \
âš¡ &nbsp; Fun fact: I had to wear an eyepatch as a child.

Currently looking for full time full stack developer work.
